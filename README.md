📌 Project Details
Project No.: P6
Project Name: Armstrong Number Checker (3-Digit)
Programming Language: C

📌 Project Overview

The Armstrong Number Checker is a console-based application developed using the C programming language.
This program checks whether a 3-digit number is an Armstrong number or not.
An Armstrong number is a number in which the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the original number.
For example:
153 → 1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 153 (Valid Armstrong Number)
This project is beginner-friendly and helps in understanding number logic in C programming.

🎯 Aim of the Project

The aim of this project is to create an Armstrong Number Checker for 3-digit numbers that determines whether the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the original number or not.

🎯 Why This Project Was Created

This project was created to:
Understand number-based logic in C
Practice loops and conditional statements
Learn how to extract digits from a number
Improve logical thinking and problem-solving skills
Learn how to validate numbers using conditions

⚙️ Features of the Project

Accepts a 3-digit number from the user
Extracts each digit of the number
Calculates the cube of each digit
Checks whether the number is an Armstrong number
Displays Valid / Invalid result
Simple and clean console output

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: C
Code Editor: Visual Studio Code
Version Control: Git & GitHub
Platform: Windows (Command Line Interface)

🚀 How the Project Works (Algorithm / Steps)

Read a number from the user and store it as the original number.
Copy the number into a temporary variable.
Use a loop to count how many digits the number has.
Store the digit count in a variable.
Again copy the original number into another variable.
Use a loop to extract each digit using % 10.
For each digit, calculate digit ^ count using a loop.
Add all calculated values together.
Compare the final sum with the original number.
Display whether the number is Armstrong (Valid) or Not Armstrong (Invalid)

📈 Utility of the Project

Helps beginners understand loops and digit manipulation
Useful for academic practicals and exams
Strengthens logic for number-based problems
Acts as a base for learning advanced mathematical programs

🔮 Future Scope of the Project
This project can be enhanced in the future by:
Extending support for n-digit Armstrong numbers
Using functions for better modular programming
Adding input validation for invalid numbers
Creating a menu-driven number checking system
Developing a GUI-based or web-based version

📚 What I Learned from This Project
While developing this project, I learned:
How to extract digits from a number using % and /
How to use loops for repeated calculations
How to apply power logic using loops
How conditional statements help in validation
How to compare calculated values with original data
How to write clean and structured C programs
🙌 Conclusion
The Armstrong Number Checker (3-Digit) project is a simple yet effective way to understand number logic, loops, and conditional statements in C programming.
This project builds a strong foundation for beginners and prepares them for more complex mathematical and logical programs.
